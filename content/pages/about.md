The GLUG-Madurai (GNU/Linux User Group of Madurai) was formerly known as [The Madurai LUG](http://linuxmadurai.tripod.com/whatis.html "Madurai LUG"). It was founded in January 2001. The first mailing list was hosted on Yahoo! Groups as [Linux-Madurai](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Linux-Madurai/ "Linux-Madurai"). Later in early 2004, the group was renamed as [GLUG-Madurai](http://glug-madurai.org) and the mailing list was moved to SourceForge.net. See the [mailing list page]({filename}mailing-list.md) for more details.

GLUG-Madurai has been fostering Free Software activities in and around Madurai. GLUG-Madurai works closely with [GLUGOT](http://glugot.tce.edu "GLUGOT") and conducts monthly meetings. Please check on the [meetings]({category}meetings) and [events]({category}events) section to know more about what we are doing.

There are no formalities to join the group. Just join the mailing list and say a 'hi' :)
