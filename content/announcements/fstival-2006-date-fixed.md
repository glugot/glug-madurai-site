The organizers have finally decided the date for FStival'06 as 16-09-2006. The venue is the same as last year in the campus of 'Thiagarajar College of Engineering'. The volunteers of [GLUGOT] are busy with the posters and other related organizational work.

If you've not grabbed your "FStival'06" T-Shirt., the time is over now. But do check with the organizers if they have an extra T-Shirt which they can sell to you.
